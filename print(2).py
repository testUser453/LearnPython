#In this file, you will be learning about print statements

#Lets start of by simply printing Hello World
#To print a statement like Hello World, we use the print statement (keep in mind that you can use single or double quotes) --> print("This is where what you want to say goes")
#Using the print statement, lets print 'Hello World'!
print("Hello World")

#If you printed this statement, in your terminal console of your text editor, IDE or computer you will see the words 'Hello World'
#In the example above you can see that we printed the string 'Hello World'

#If you would like to print an integer you do this print(your integer value)
#Lets do this by printing the integer 5
print(5)

#In your terminal you can see that we printed the value 5

#Now lets print the value of a variable 'x' that equals the integer 10
x = 10
print(x)

#Now, in your terminal you can see the number 10


#That is the basics of the print statement you will learn more about different ways the print statement can be used in other topics like math operations (mathop.py) and etc.
